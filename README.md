# 🕒 Digital Clock Web App

A responsive, real-time digital clock built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The app displays the current local time with an AM/PM indicator, includes the current date, and offers a toggle between light and dark themes. It uses a modern neon-glass UI and adapts to various screen sizes for a smooth mobile or desktop experience.
